# Sequence Alignment
Uses dynamic programming to handle the issue of pairwise alignment

example input (DNA bases A, C, G, T):

sequence one:  ACCGGGTACCGGGGAAAATTT

sequence two:  ACCGTACCGGAGGAAATT

output (aligned sequences):

sequence one: ACCGGGTACCGG_GGAAAATTT

sequence two: ACC__GTACCGGAGG_AAA_TT
